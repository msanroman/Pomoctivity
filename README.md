# Pomoctivity

> Time to get things productive again, like a badass Android user.

This is my Android application for IDI. It's just an improvement of Pomodorus, getting rid of task categories and pomodoro-sharing via Twitter. It just aims to get more usable by adding more gestures into the list view.

This page is just a mock up of what's coming :)

## Features:

* Create, edit and re-order tasks at will.
* Three different filters for your task list.
* Task & break timers.

## List gestures:

* Delete task: An horizontal swipe will show you the delete task icon.
* Extra options: With a long tap on any item from your list a menu will show up the edit, finish, order or start pomodoro options.
* Stay tuned for more actions!
