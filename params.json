{"name":"Pomoctivity","tagline":"Pomodoro task manager for InteracciÃ³ i Disseny d'Interficies","body":"> Time to get things productive again, like a badass Android user.\r\n\r\nThis is my Android application for IDI. It's just an improvement of Pomodorus, getting rid of task categories and pomodoro-sharing via Twitter. It just aims to get more usable by adding more gestures into the list view.\r\n\r\nThis page is just a mock up of what's coming :)\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n\r\n* Create, edit and re-order tasks at will.\r\n* Three different filters for your task list.\r\n* Task & break timers.\r\n\r\n## List gestures\r\n\r\n* Delete task: An horizontal swipe will show you the delete task icon.\r\n* Extra options: With a long tap on any item from your list a menu will show up the edit, finish, order or start pomodoro options.\r\n* Stay tuned for more actions!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
